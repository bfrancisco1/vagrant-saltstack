# On CentOS, epel-release is available in the default repositories.  Therefore,
# ius-release can just resolve the dependency automatically.  On RHEL (or other
# RHEL clones) you will need to explicitly install epel-release first.  This
# state declaration can be moved to it's own state if you want to be able to
# require it independently of the IUS state declaration.
